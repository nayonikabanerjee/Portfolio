            Georgia Tech students are losing their personal belongings at an alarming rate with most never being found again. By creating an app to connect those who find items with those who have lost them, we hope to connect students with their beloved belongings.
            
            I served as a Lead Designer and used tools such as Figma and FigJam.

                Challenge: Students on campus are losing anything and everything from student/government ID's, house keys, jewelry, and more. While there are a few physical lost and founds on campus, students are not happy with the lack of help when items are lost.

                Solution: After completing our user research, we designed an app that can be used to ensure that users have a much higher chance of being reunited with what they lost. We created a simple and easy to use interface to prevent users from becoming overwhelmed and encouraging use of our platform.

                User Interviews: We conducted 7 interviews with students and staff members who have lost items on campus to gauge the severity of the issue as well as the steps turned to when things are lost. 
                To understand how people felt about the issue, we asked our interview participants questions like what items have you lost on campus and how do you want this process to be improved?
                
                Through our questions, we noticed a few similar ideologies popping up and identified our key issues.

                Key Finding #1: Many people upload images of lost student IDs on a shared snap story as well as class group chats which irritates users who are not involved in the situation.

                Key Finding #2: Items are easily lost on campus because students are constantly moving and distracted. It is easy for items to fall out of a pocket and not be noticed for hours.

                Competitive Analysis: Trying to find similar services out there was tricky as the phenomenon of college students losing items is widely overlooked. We chose to focus our research GroupMe, SnapChat, Liff Happens and the Student Center Help Desk.â€‹            </p>

                User Flow: Based on our pain points, we wanted to build our design around simple isolated functions where the majority of the interaction happens between the finder and the looker. To accomplish this, we decided to implement 2 main sections: a general "marketplace" of sorts as well as a page dedicated to finding and reporting IDs.

                Lo-Fi Wireframe: We decided to reconfigure our design a bit to make the onboarding process easier and came up with this general layout. It includes features like a scroll menu, drop down tabs, and pop ups.

                Hi-Fi Wireframes: We decided on our color scheme and started narrowing down fonts. An issue we encountered as on our color pallette as we didn't know how much of GT we wanted to resemble. We also had to rethink some of the frames due to security concerns from user testers.
