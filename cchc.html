            CCHC is a local health center dedicated to serving anyone who needs help. Their patients speak a variety of different languages, so they would like to create a database of valuable information so patients can learn more in a reliable and multilingual domain. It is our task to design the database.            
            
            I served as a Designer and used tools such as Figma and FigJam.

                Challenge: Many CCHC patient's first language is not english, but accessing medical information in their own language isn't easy. The information they do find may be dated, incorrect, or difficult to find.

                Solution: CCHC is creating a database of medical information in 12+ languages like Urdu and Swahili to make information as accessible as possible and have tasked an Epic Intentions consulting team with creating a design for the site.

                Client Interview: We set up an interview with the head of the CCHC to learn more about what they wanted out of their database. We cleared up issues like whether or not documents would be embedded or hyperlinked, what version of their branding they wanted us to use, and what features they wanted above all us. This provided us with a good starting ground to start our research into similar products and to pull what was similar.

                Competitive Analysis: There are a lot of health databases existing, so it was not hard to find a handful to compare against one another. The main feature that sets us apart is our 12+ languages.

                User persona: Creating a user persona was simple because this website is so localized to the Clarkston clinic and they know well who their target audience is. As the website grows and broadens, more personas will be needed to update the site.

                Lo-Fi Wireframe: We used their existing website as a starting off point and created two different options for a user to view information for an article. One is for a pdf to be embedded and another is for text to be formatted directly. We want to develop both options and let the client choose.
